              <p>You acknowledge, and further agree that FrozenOrb has no obligation to defend, indemnify or hold harmless you in any way related to this agreement, including but not limited to your use of the Services, use of the Services by any person, or any connection between the foregoing and any other person or entity that becomes aware of your use of the Services at any time.</p>
              <p>This Section shall survive the termination of this agreement.</p>
              <h2><strong>8. Dispute Resolution</strong></h2>
              <p><strong>Informal Resolution.</strong> With respect to any Dispute, you agree to attempt to negotiate the resolution of any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or other proceeding, including any legal proceeding in court or before an administrative agency. Such informal negotiations commence upon FrozenOrb&#39;s receipt of Notice from you.</p>
              <p><strong>Contact Information.</strong> FrozenOrb can be reached at: <a href="https://www.lunar.gg/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8be7eeeceae7cbc6e4e4e5f8fce4f9ffe3a5e8e4e6">[email&#160;protected]</a></p>
              <p><strong>Mandatory Binding Arbitration.</strong> If you are not able to satisfactorily resolve a Dispute informally within a total of thirty (30) days, or if FrozenOrb, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that it will not be possible to satisfactorily resolve that Dispute informally within a total of thirty (30) days, you agree that either you or FrozenOrb may request resolution by final and fully binding arbitration conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The party requesting that a Dispute be resolved by arbitration under this Section shall be responsible for initiating such a proceeding.</p>
              <p>The American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) will run the arbitration between you and FrozenOrb, and AAA&rsquo;s rules and procedures (including their Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, if applicable) will be used. If something in these Terms is different than AAA&rsquo;s rules and procedures, then we will follow these Terms instead. You can look at AAA&rsquo;s rules and procedures on their website www.adr.org or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879.</p>
              <p>YOU UNDERSTAND, AND FURTHER AGREE, THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONSULT WITH INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL OF YOUR OWN CHOOSING REGARDING THIS AND ANY OTHER PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THIS BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL ELIMINATE YOUR LEGAL RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT, TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, AND/OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH DISPUTE. You and FrozenOrb both agree that neither shall attempt to have any other arbitration or class action related to any other party joined to any arbitration in which you are involved with FrozenOrb. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no arbitration proceeding shall be decided on a class-action basis or utilizing class action procedures. You and FrozenOrb further agree that each may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or a class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.</p>
              <p><strong>Waiver by You.</strong> You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action that you may wish to assert related in any manner to the Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action accrued or be forever barred.</p>
              <h2><strong>9. Miscellaneous</strong></h2>
              <p><strong>Changes.</strong> It is your responsibility to read, understand, and accept this agreement in connection with your use of the Services. You acknowledge that FrozenOrb may make changes to these Terms of Service at any time, and that Section headings in this agreement are for purposes of convenience only. Unless FrozenOrb states otherwise, any changes to these Terms are effective when posted. If you continue to use the Services after any changes are posted then you agree that those changes will apply to your continued use of the Services. You should check this page regularly to stay informed about any changes.</p>
              <p><strong>Complete Agreement.</strong> This agreement: (1) is the final and complete agreement and understanding of the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces any and all prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings with respect thereto; (2) may not be changed, amended, or in any manner modified by you except as authorized in a writing signed by both parties&rsquo; authorized agents; (3) is not assignable, except to a successor in interest to substantially all of a party&rsquo;s business or assets and any other attempt to assign or transfer this agreement or any interest herein is void; and (4) shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto, their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors, personal representatives, licensees, and assigns.</p>
              <p><strong>Force Majeure.</strong> No party shall be responsible for delays or failure of performance resulting from acts beyond the reasonable control of such party, including, war, terrorism, acts of public enemies, strikes or other labor disturbances, power failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, acts of God, and other natural disasters.</p>
              <p><strong>Waiver.</strong> No act or failure to act by FrozenOrb will be deemed a waiver of any right contained in this agreement, and any waiver by FrozenOrb must be in writing and signed by an officer of FrozenOrb. If FrozenOrb does expressly waive any provision of this agreement, such waiver shall not be a waiver of any other provisions of this agreement, and the waived provision shall not be waived for all time in the future.</p>
              <p><strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision or sub-provision of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision or sub-provision shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement in a manner most closely representing the intention of the parties as expressed herein.</p>
              <p><strong>Remedies.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that any violation or threatened violation of this agreement will cause irreparable injury to FrozenOrb, entitling FrozenOrb to seek injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damages, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity. You specifically acknowledge that money damages alone would be an inadequate remedy for the injuries and damages that would be suffered and incurred by FrozenOrb as a result of a breach of any of the provisions of this agreement.</p>
              <p><strong>Language.</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, the controlling language for these Terms of Service is English.</p>
